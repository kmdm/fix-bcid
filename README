When unrevoked fails stating a Validation error due to a missing backup cid, 
this is when you can use this utility.

$ adb shell
$ adb push fix-bcid /data/local
$ /system/__unrevoked_su
# /data/local/fix-bcid

If the utility finishes successfully then you may re-run unrevoked which should
now be able to work its magic.
